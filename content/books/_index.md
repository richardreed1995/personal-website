This is a list of books that I’ve enjoyed and recommend to others. 

Most books I skim through, but these are the ones I’ve gone back and reread. 

## 1. Millionaire Fastlane

I read this when I was just starting out with my own business. It’s a nice mix of storytelling and frameworks that break many of the limiting beliefs we have about money and freedom. This is a great book for anyone interested in doing their own thing. 

## 2. How to Get Rich

This is a great book that goes into the reality of trying to get rich. Where a lot of business books paint getting rich as this magical journey that’s easy, Felix shows the reality of the situation in a way that demands uncommon sacrifice, focus, and willingness to make difficult decisions that most people avoid. The book's candour about the loneliness and challenges of entrepreneurship gave me some comfort that hard times were to be expected on this path and were par for the course. 

My key takeaway was ownership is everything—equity in a growing enterprise is the true path to wealth. Delegate tasks but never abdicate control of crucial decisions. 

## 3. The Dip

One of my biggest problems at the start of my journey was starting something, seeing some success, then switching to the next best thing. It took a few loops to realise that nothing is easier and there is always a dip in any business. However, the challenge is always to find the balance between being stubborn vs facing challenges that are worth overcoming. 

My key takeaway was to make a decision to have a narrow and specific focus and strategically quit everything else. Given our limited resources, we can have enough energy to push through the dip and reach excellence, especially when starting out with little leverage. 

## 4. Built to Sell

I binged read this book and I’ve given a copy to friends who are starting out with their own business. I learnt about being purposeful and focused on building a business the right way. 

My takeaway was to create a system that can deliver results without me. Have one process that can be successfully applied to one niche, and avoid the common trap of trying to do everything for everyone. 

## 5. Getting Everything You Can Out of All You&#39;ve Got

I read this book as my agency was starting to scale. It shined a light on all the untapped potential that lay in the business, and how much more could be squeezed from it. It narrowed my focus on serving clients rather than selling customers, which created a network effect of advocates and more clients. 

## 6. 10x Is Easier Than 2x

This was another book I read as I was scaling my agency. The premise is that by setting more ambitious goals, it focuses your strategy as there is fewer ways to get there. 10x goals eliminate competition by moving you to a different playing field entirely. Bigger thinking naturally attracts better collaboration, talent, and opportunities. Transformational growth requires reinvention and fundamental changes to your approach, not just optimisation of current methods.

Also anecdotally, one of the best pieces of advice I got at school was to set your intention to the highest marks, and do the actions to get yourself there. You often get to 80% of your goal, so aiming higher will help you expand what’s possible in your mind.
